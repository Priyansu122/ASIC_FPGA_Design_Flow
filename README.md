# ASIC_FPGA_Design_Flow
This page will contain the steps to install the tools required for both [FPGA](#FPGA_FLOW) and ASIC flow and the steps to execute the flow in digital design.
## Tools required
- For FPGA flow we need tools like</br>
  1. Iverilog and gtkwave - For simulation and Functional verification
  2. Yosys - for synthesis
  3. NextPnr - For Place and route
  4. Project IceStorm - tools for working with Lattice ICE40 bitstreams
- For ASIC Flow we need tools like</br>
  1. Iverilog and gtkwave - For simulation and Functional verification
  2. Yosys - for synthesis
  3. OpenSTA - For static time analysis report
  4. OpenRoad - For Physical design
- We will be discussing about installation of the tools and steps to use them in the subsequent sections.
